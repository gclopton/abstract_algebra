# What your MATH 512 course is actually about

I read your syllabus. The course is a first pass through **scheme-theoretic algebraic geometry**, with sheaves and affine schemes at the start, then Proj, properties of morphisms, quasi-coherent sheaves, divisors (Weil & Cartier), the Picard group, and Kähler differentials. The primary texts listed are **Hartshorne, _Algebraic Geometry_** and **Görtz–Wedhorn, _Algebraic Geometry I: Schemes_** (with **Vakil’s _FOAG_** and **Qing Liu** as auxiliary references). Assessment is regular homework plus a final project.  
The week-by-week plan runs from a quick review of category theory and sheaves (Weeks 1–2) through affine/projective schemes, morphism properties, quasi-coherent modules, divisors and Picard, then relative Spec/Proj, projective bundles, blow-ups, differentials, and smoothness (Weeks 3–15).

Below is a **ladder of books**—starting intuitive and geometric, then bridging to schemes, then matching your course’s level—plus the commutative-algebra and category-theory background that will make the main texts feel much lighter.

---

# From intuitive geometry to scheme theory: a reading ladder

**1) Intuitive, picture-first foundations (varieties and curves).**  
If you want an “I can see it” beginning before schemes, start here. These cultivate geometric instinct, examples, and classical language.

- **Cox–Little–O’Shea, _Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms_ (CLO).** Hands-on polynomial geometry and Gröbner bases; builds the ideals↔varieties dictionary through computations and pictures.
    
- **Reid, _Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry_.** Short, witty, concrete; perfect for grasping varieties, maps, and blow-ups in the classical setting.
    
- **Harris, _Algebraic Geometry: A First Course_.** A lively tour of classical AG (line bundles, divisors, curves, and a lot of geometry). It’s variety-centric but injects taste and examples you’ll keep using.
    
- **Fulton, _Algebraic Curves_ (or Miranda, _Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces_).** Either gives you a complete playground of examples (divisors, Riemann–Roch) on curves before you meet them in the scheme world.
    

**2) Bridge texts that gently introduce schemes.**  
These books move you from “varieties over an algebraically closed field” to the generality of schemes without dropping you straight into EGA-style abstraction.

- **Eisenbud & Harris, _The Geometry of Schemes_.** The single best “bridging” book: geometric intuition for Spec, Proj, nilpotents, embedded points, blow-ups, and line bundles—with pictures and examples.
    
- **Mumford, _The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes_.** A compact, historically minded transition: varieties first, then the scheme perspective.
    
- **Perrin, _Algebraic Geometry: An Introduction_.** Modern, example-oriented; varieties to schemes with many worked examples.
    

**3) Core scheme-theory texts at the level of your course.**  
These are exactly what your syllabus expects you to read and solve problems from.

- **Görtz & Wedhorn, _Algebraic Geometry I: Schemes_.** Clear definitions, many examples, lots of exercises; great as your day-to-day textbook for sheaves on schemes, affine/projective schemes, morphisms, quasi-coherent sheaves, divisors, Picard, and differentials. (It’s one of your two official texts.)
    
- **Vakil, _The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry_ (FOAG).** Authoritative, expansive, and free; sections on sheaves, Spec/Proj, properties of morphisms, divisor theory, line bundles, and blow-ups are especially good for second and third explanations. (Listed on your syllabus as a recommended reference.)
    
- **Hartshorne, _Algebraic Geometry_.** The canonical text and also your official one. Read it as your **primary theoretical source** for the course topics, but pair it with GW/Vakil for examples and more gradual proofs.
    
- **Qing Liu, _Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves_.** Superb when your course hits divisors on curves, Picard, and smoothness; its treatment of curves, differentials, and arithmetic flavors is famously clean. (Also on your syllabus.)
    

**4) Commutative algebra you’ll actually use.**  
Schemes are built from commutative algebra. If any of this feels wobbly, these are the fastest stabilizers.

- **Atiyah–Macdonald, _Introduction to Commutative Algebra_.** Short, surgical, and exactly the algebra behind Spec/Proj, localizations, dimension, integrality, primary decomposition.
    
- **Eisenbud, _Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry_.** Friendly narrative + depth; dimension theory, regular sequences, depth/grade, and blow-ups from the algebraic side.
    

**5) Light category theory + sheaf fluency.**  
Week 1 starts with categorical notions and sheaves, so a little prep pays off immediately.

- **Aluffi, _Algebra: Chapter 0_.** A category-aware algebra text: limits/colimits, adjoints, Yoneda sprinkled through familiar algebra.
    
- **Leinster, _Basic Category Theory_.** A fast, modern primer if you want a focused category-theory warm-up.
    
- For sheaves specifically: **Vakil’s early sheaf chapters** plus **Hartshorne II.1** give all you need for this course; if you crave more, **Tennison, _Sheaf Theory_** is a gentle classic.
    

---

# How to use this stack with your syllabus

Start with **one week of runway** to get fluent with categories and sheaves: read Aluffi/Leinster selectively for basic categorical language, then take Vakil’s sheaf chapter alongside Hartshorne II.1 at a skim-level; Görtz–Wedhorn’s opening chapters will feel much friendlier right after. This matches your Week 1–2 emphasis.

As Weeks 2–5 move through affine schemes, morphisms, and **Proj**, make **Görtz–Wedhorn** your daily driver and keep **Eisenbud–Harris** open whenever a definition feels too austere; when proofs get terse, dip into **Vakil** for a second pass. For **Proj** and projective morphisms, triangulate between GW’s construction, Vakil’s examples, and Hartshorne II.5 to lock in intuition and exact statements.

Weeks 6–7 bring **quasi-coherent sheaves** and very ample line bundles. Here GW’s exposition and exercises are ideal, while **Hartshorne II** supplies the canonical framing; if coherence vs. quasi-coherence or Serre’s twisting sheaf feels slippery, read the corresponding FOAG sections and then try two or three GW problems.

Weeks 8–11 cover **dimension, divisors, curves, Picard**. For divisors and Picard, it’s very effective to do the story twice: first on **curves** (Liu or Harris/Fulton for concrete feel), then in the scheme setting (GW + Hartshorne). The curve-first pass makes Cartier vs. Weil divisors, degree, and linear equivalence almost automatic when you scale up.

Weeks 12–15 take you into **relative Spec/Proj, projective bundles, blow-ups, differentials, smoothness**. Read the clean construction in GW, then enrich your geometric intuition with **Eisenbud–Harris** (excellent pictures and examples of blow-ups) and check Hartshorne for the tight statements. For differentials and smoothness, Liu’s curve chapters plus the algebra in Atiyah–Macdonald or Eisenbud (module of Kähler differentials, Jacobian criterion) make the scheme-level definitions feel natural.

All the while, keep **Atiyah–Macdonald** nearby for short algebraic lemmas (localization, integral dependence, primary decomposition) that your proofs will quietly rely on.

---

# A compact plan if you’re short on time

Begin with **Reid** (or a fast skim of **CLO** chapters 1–4) for geometric instinct, jump to **Eisenbud–Harris** for a week to internalize Spec/Proj and blow-ups with pictures, then use **Görtz–Wedhorn** for your main march through the syllabus, consulting **Vakil** whenever you want a roomier explanation and **Hartshorne** for the canonical proofs and problem sets. When exercises expose an algebra gap, patch it with 5–10 pages of **Atiyah–Macdonald**.

---

# Why this ladder fits your syllabus

Because your course explicitly centers sheaves, Spec/Proj, quasi-coherent sheaves, divisors/Picard, differentials, blow-ups, and smoothness, the progression above moves you from pictures → schemes → the exact theorems and constructions the class will test and use. The official and recommended texts on your syllabus anchor the middle and top of the ladder; the others are there to make those texts readable at speed and to keep your geometric intuition alive as the abstraction ramps up.

If you’d like, I can turn this into a week-by-week reading plan keyed to the exact **Week N** topics listed in your schedule—with page ranges from GW/Hartshorne/Vakil and a small set of exercises to prioritize each week.


# Abstract Algebra


You can absolutely get there from an engineering-math background. For this course you need fluency with proof-based algebra, a compact dose of commutative algebra, point-set topology, a little category theory, and a gentle on-ramp to sheaves and schemes before you live in the official texts (Hartshorne; Görtz–Wedhorn). The syllabus confirms the emphasis: sheaves, Spec/Proj, properties of morphisms, quasi-coherent modules, divisors & Picard, and Kähler differentials.

# A short, realistic book ladder

**1) Proof style (only if you feel rusty).**  
Daniel Velleman, _How to Prove It_ (3e). Skim Chapters 1–5 to make proofs automatic; then move on. If you’re already comfortable writing clear ε-δ/induction/contradiction proofs, you can skip this.

**2) Abstract algebra at a graduate-ready level (your springboard).**  
Dummit & Foote, _Abstract Algebra_ (3e). Work the ring/module core carefully: rings & ideals; modules over a PID; Noetherian rings; UFDs; tensor products; field extensions (enough to be comfortable with finite extensions and algebraic closures). If you prefer a lighter entry, do Artin’s _Algebra_ first, then deepen with Dummit–Foote.

**3) The commutative algebra you will actually use.**  
Atiyah & Macdonald, _Introduction to Commutative Algebra_. This is the single most time-efficient upgrade for schemes. Read it straight through (localization; prime/max ideals; modules; Nakayama; integrality; primary decomposition; Noether normalization; Krull dimension). When you want more context or geometry: Eisenbud, _Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry_, selected chapters.

**4) Point-set topology (to make Zariski topologies feel normal).**  
Munkres, _Topology_ (2e), Part I essentials: continuity, product/quotient topologies, compactness, connectedness, separation axioms (know T₀/T₁/T₂). You don’t need algebraic topology for this course; just be fully at ease with the language of topological spaces.

**5) Just enough category theory.**  
Leinster, _Basic Category Theory_ (Chs. 1–3). Aim for comfort with functors, natural transformations, limits/colimits, adjoints in baby cases, and Yoneda at the level of “what it says” rather than full mastery. Alternatively, Aluffi’s _Algebra: Chapter 0_ sprinkles exactly this categorical viewpoint through familiar algebra.

**6) A geometric bridge from varieties to schemes.**  
Cox–Little–O’Shea, _Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms_ (Chs. 1–4) for concrete pictures and computation; then Eisenbud & Harris, _The Geometry of Schemes_, which recasts those pictures in the language of Spec/Proj, nilpotents, embedded points, line bundles, and blow-ups. Reid’s _Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry_ is a quick, witty complement if you like short geometric chapters.

**7) Sheaves, divisors, and curves with clean proofs.**  
Vakil, _The Rising Sea (FOAG)_: read the early sheaf chapters and the introductions to Spec/Proj and properties of morphisms as your “second explanation” resource; it’s also superb on divisors and line bundles. For curves/divisors done crisply (and later Kähler differentials), Qing Liu, _Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves_, selected chapters, is gold.

**8) Then the course-level texts.**  
Görtz & Wedhorn, _Algebraic Geometry I: Schemes_ as your day-to-day text (definitions, examples, and exercises are friendlier), with Hartshorne, _Algebraic Geometry_, as the canonical reference you learn to read alongside it. Keep FOAG open for alternate proofs and extra context. These match your syllabus exactly.

# If time is tight (a “minimum viable ramp”)

Do this sequence and you’ll still be fine: Atiyah–Macdonald → Dummit–Foote (ring/module core only) → Eisenbud & Harris (_Geometry of Schemes_) → Görtz–Wedhorn (primary) with Hartshorne for the official formulations and FOAG for a slower second pass on sheaves/Spec/Proj/divisors. Whenever a proof leans on algebra you don’t fully own, patch with 2–3 pages of A&M and keep moving.

# How to work

Treat exercises as the main event: in A&M and GW, aim to solve a steady stream of short, technical problems (localization computations, checking universal properties, verifying quasi-coherence, divisor arithmetic on curves). As those become routine, Hartshorne’s problems will feel less forbidding. And as you read, keep a one-page “dictionary” of the exact statements you use (Nakayama, Going-Up/Down, universal property of Proj, Serre’s criterion, Jacobian criterion): that cheat-sheet becomes your mental toolkit for the course topics.

If you want, I can turn this into a two-phase schedule (2–4 weeks of ramp + in-term pairing of GW/Hartshorne) with exact chapter ranges and a small, high-yield exercise set for each week.
