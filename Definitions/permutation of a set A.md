A permutation is a perfect re-labeling of $\boldsymbol{A}$ : it pairs each element of $\boldsymbol{A}$ with exactly one element of $\boldsymbol{A}$, and every element is used exactly once. In other words, it's a bijection from $A$ onto itself.

A permutation is a bijection $\sigma: A \rightarrow A$. (The set of all permutations of a finite $A$ forms the symmetric group $S_{|A|}$.)
