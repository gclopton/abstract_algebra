Given a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ and a subset $C$ of $B$, the preimage of $C$ is the subset of $A$ consisting of all inputs whose outputs lie in $C$. For a single element  of $B$, the preimage of $\{b\}$ is the set of all inputs sent exactly to $b$ (the fiber over $b$ ).

For $C \subseteq B$,

$$
f^{-1}(C)=\{a \in A \mid f(a) \in C\} \subseteq A .
$$

(If $b \in B$, the fiber over $b$ is $f^{-1}(\{b\})=\{a \in A \mid f(a)=b\}$.)
