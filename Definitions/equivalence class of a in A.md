Fix an equivalence relation. The class of $a$ is the full set of elements that are equivalent to $a$ under that relation-the "bucket" containing $a$ and everything indistinguishable from $a$ by that criterion.

---

For an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $A$, the class of $a$ is

$$
[a]_{\sim}=\{x \in A \mid x \sim a\} .
$$
