If $g$ is defined only on a subset $S$ of a larger set $B$, an extension is a new function $G$ that accepts every element of $B$ but agrees with $g$ on the original domain $S$. Informally: you keep the old values and consistently fill in the missing ones.

If $g: S \rightarrow C$ with $S \subseteq B$, an extension of $g$ to $B$ is any function $G: B \rightarrow C$ such that $\left.G\right|_S=g$.
