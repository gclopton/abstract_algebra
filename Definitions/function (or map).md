A function from $A$ to $B$ ::: $f: A \rightarrow B$ (also written $A \xrightarrow{f} B$ ) is a rule that assigns to each element of a $a \in A$ a unique element (one and only one) of $B$ ::: $f(a) \in B$. Here  is the domain and  is the codomain (never assigns two different outputs to the same input).
