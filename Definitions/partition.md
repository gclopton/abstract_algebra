A partition of $A$ is a collection of nonempty pieces that cover $A$ without overlap: every element of $A$ lies in exactly one piece.

A collection $\left\{A_i\right\}_{i \in I}$ of nonempty subsets of $A$ such that (i) $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i=A$ and (ii) $A_i \cap A_j=\varnothing$ whenever $i \neq j$. The sets $A_i$ are called the blocks (or parts) of the partition.
