Given a function $f: A \rightarrow B$, the image of $f$ is the subset of $B$ consisting of exactly those elements that occur as $f(a)$ for some $a$ in $A$. For a subset $S$ of $A$, the image $f(S)$ is the set of values $f(s)$ with $s$ in $S$.

That is, the image of $f$ is the set of actual outputs:

$$
\operatorname{Im}(f)=f(A)=\{f(a) \mid a \in A\} \subseteq B .
$$

(Some authors use "range" to mean the codomain; here "range" = image.) For a subset $S \subseteq A$, the image of $S$ is $f(S)=\{f(s) \mid s \in S\}$.
