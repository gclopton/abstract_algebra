Suppose $f$ sends elements of $A$ into $B$. A map $g$ that goes back from $B$ to $A$ is a two-sided inverse of $f$ when the two round-trips both "do nothing": first apply $f$ then $g$ and you recover your original element of $A$; first apply $g$ then $f$ and you recover your original element of $B$. When such a $g$ exists, $f$ is a bijection and $g$ is the usual inverse function.

Let $f: A \rightarrow B$. A map $g: B \rightarrow A$ is a (two-sided) inverse of $f$ if

$$
g \circ f=\mathrm{id}_A \quad \text { and } \quad f \circ g=\mathrm{id}_B .
$$


Equivalently, $f$ is bijective and $g=f^{-1}$.
