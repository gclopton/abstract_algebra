A binary relation between two sets $X$ and $Y$ is just a specified collection of ordered pairs $(x, y)$. We read ( $x, y$ ) being in the relation as " $x$ is related to $y$." A relation "on $A$ " means both coordinates come from $A$.

Between sets $X$ and $Y$, a binary relation $R$ is a subset $R \subseteq X \times Y$. A relation "on $A$ " means $R \subseteq A \times$ A.
