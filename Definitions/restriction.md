Given a function $f$ defined on all of $A$, its restriction to a subset $S \subseteq A$ is the same rule, but you're only allowed to feed it inputs from $S$. Outputs are whatever $f$ already assigned to those inputs.

If $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $S \subseteq A$, the restriction of $f$ to $S$ is the function $\left.f\right|_S: S \rightarrow B$ defined by $\left.f\right|_S(s)= f(s)$ for all $s \in S$.
