There is a one-to-one match between the two ideas. Starting from an equivalence relation, group each element with all things equivalent to it; these groups are disjoint and cover $\boldsymbol{A}$, so they form a partition. Conversely, starting from a partition, declare two elements equivalent exactly when they lie in the same piece; that rule is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Doing one construction and then the other gets you back where you started.

(1) If $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation on $A$ then the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$ form a partition of $A$.
(2) If $\left\{A_i \mid i \in I\right\}$ is a partition of $A$ then there is an equivalence relation on $A$ whose equivalence classes are precisely the sets $A_i, i \in I$.
