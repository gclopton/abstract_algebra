# 0.1 Basics


- [[order (or cardinality) of a set]]
	- if A is a finite set, the order of A is simply the number of elements in A
- **Concept:** [[how to test whether a particular x in A lies in a subset B of A]]
- [[cartesian product of two sets A and B]] is the collection $A \times B = \lbrace(a, b) \vert a \in A, b \in B \rbrace$ of ordered pairs of elements A and B.
- **Concept:** [[notation for common sets of numbers]]
- [[function (or map)]]
- [[domain]]
- [[codomain]]
- [[well defined]]
- [[range or image of f (image of A under f)]] $f^{-1}(C)=\{a \in A \mid f(a) \in C\}$
- [[preimage (or inverse image)]]
- [[injective (injection)]]
- [[surjective (surjection)]]
- [[bijective (bijection)]]
	- [[bijective correspondence]]
- [[left inverse]]
- [[right inverse]]
- ==Proposition 1:== [[determining if a map is injective, surjective, or bijective]]
- [[2-sided inverse (inverse) of f]]
- [[permutation of a set A]]
- [[restriction]]
- [[extension of g to B]]
	- **Note:** The extension of g to B need not exist or be unique
- [[binary relation]]
	- [[reflexive relation]]
	- [[symmetric relation]]
	- [[transitive relation]]
- [[equivalence relation]]
- [[equivalence class of a in A]]
- [[partition]]
- Proposition 2: [[correspondence between equivalence relations and partitions]]
