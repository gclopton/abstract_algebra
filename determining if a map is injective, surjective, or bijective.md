(1) The map $\boldsymbol{f}$ is injective if and only if $\boldsymbol{f}$ has a left inverse.
(2) The map $f$ is surjective if and only if $f$ has a right inverse.
(3) The map $f$ is a bijection if and only if there exists $g: B \rightarrow A$ such that $f \circ g$ is the identity map on $B$ and $g \circ f$ is the identity map on $A$.
(4) If $A$ and $B$ are finite sets with the same number of elements (i.e., $|A|=|B|$ ), then $f: A \rightarrow B$ is bijective if and only if $f$ is injective if and only if $f$ is surjective.
